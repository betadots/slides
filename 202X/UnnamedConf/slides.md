## Why clean code matters?

![speaker](images/clean-code-symbol-ai.png)

* Imagine the code base is like your house
* Having non standardized stairs sucks?
* Having standards helps everyone
* You want to keep it clean and organized
* Readability is key
* Don't let junk accumulate
* Regularly refactor and tidy up

* Directory structure
* Documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
* Testing (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
* CI/CD pipelines
* Commit signing
